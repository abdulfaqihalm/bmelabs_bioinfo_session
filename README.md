# bmelabs_bioinfo_session
This is the repository for bmelabs bioinfo sharing session. 

## Prerequisites
- We hope you already read a bunch of stuffs about R for data sicence [here](https://r4ds.hadley.nz/). Mostly we will use tidyverse package.  
- Familiar with hypothesis testing: parametric (t-test, ANOVA), non-parametric (Mann–Whitney U, Kruskal–Wallis) and FDR correction (Bonferroni, BH).
- Clone this session repo.
- Install R and its dependencies.
  
To setup the environment for your machine, please run either `setup.bash`(for Unix/Linux) or `setup.ps1`(for Windows) depending on your operating system.

All of the materials are coded in R. You can use any text editor that you like the most. However, we suggest you to install [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/).


If there is enough time, we will walk through the de-facto file formats within bioinformatics!
